"""Tests for validate_kiss.py - KISS principle validator.

TDD Cycle 3: KISS validator tests
- Function length should count inclusive lines (fix off-by-one)
- Complexity thresholds should trigger violations correctly
- Nesting depth detection should work accurately

TDD Cycle 4: Cognitive complexity
- Cognitive complexity should weight nested structures more heavily
- Should flag code that is hard to read even with moderate cyclomatic complexity

TDD Cycle 5: Edge case hardening
- Syntax errors should be silently skipped (no crash)
- Unicode decode errors should be silently skipped
- Empty files should be handled gracefully
